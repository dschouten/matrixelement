The code is based on the following two publications:
"Analytical solution of ttbar dilepton equations" published in Phys. Rev. D 73 054015 (2006)
(latest updated version	available at arXiv:hep-ph/0603011v3 including massive anti-/neutrinos)

Irreducible Singularities are circumvented exploiting Ansatz made in 
"Algebraic Approach to solve ttbar dilepton equations" Phys. Rev. D 72 095020 (2005)
(latest updated version available at arXiv:hep-ph/0510100v2 including massive anti-/neutrinos)

The case of massive neutrinos and anti-neutrinos is interesting for BSM channels with same topology.

The src/main.cc program shows an example, how to make use of the analytical solution.
Compilation via gmake main.x
