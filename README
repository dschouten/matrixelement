Overview
--------

This is the primary software package for the ATLAS H->WW Matrix Element analysis.  It contains code for:

	-Integration
	-Matrix elements
	-Evaluation of matrix elements on events

The code is built using CMake and has the following requirements:

	-ROOT
	-Boost
	-GSL (The GNU Scientific Library)

Please read the INSTALL file for instructions on building and running the code easily on either lxplus or your local system.


Code Layout
-----------

What follows is a rough layout of the code.  Only important directories are outlined.

	cmake/ (Useful scripts and modules for the CMake build system)
	cuba/ (A N-dimensional (with N > 1 for some reason) integration library)
	cubature/ (An adaptive integration library) [NOT USED BUT BUILT ANYWAY]
	exec/ (Useful script for executing the code)
	integrator/ (A C++ library which provides a common integration inteface, abstracting the lower-level implementation)
	madgraph/ (The common wavefunction/coupling routines called by the matrix elements)
		CERNLIB/ (A collection of old CERN routines) [NOT USED BUT BUILT ANYWAY]
		DHELAS/ (The current version of the madgraph coupling/wave function routines)
		HELAS/ (The old version of the madgraph coupling/wave function routines) [NOT USED BUT BUILT ANYWAY]
	matrix/ (The core of the analysis which connects the integration libraries to the matrix elements)
		fsrc/ (The Fortran source code of the matrix element routines)
		matrix/ (The interface of the Feynman integral classes)
		src/ (The implementation of the Feynman integral classes)
	mtt/ (A ttbar mass reconstruction routine)
	ttanalysis/
